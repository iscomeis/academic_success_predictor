# ðŸŽ“ **Predicting Academic Success: Graduate, Enrolled, or Dropout?** ðŸ“Š

- Academic success is a cornerstone of personal and societal development, and understanding the factors influencing educational outcomes has become a critical area of research. In this project, we aim to predict the academic trajectory of studentsâ€”whether they graduate, remain enrolled, or drop outâ€”using machine learning and deep learning classification models. 

- Leveraging a comprehensive dataset/competition sourced from [Kaggle's Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 6](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e6/data), we delve into diverse features such as **student demographics**, **academic performance**, **parental education**, and even **macroeconomic indicators** like GDP and unemployment rates. This multifaceted approach allows us to capture the intricate dynamics that shape academic outcomes.
